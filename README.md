#SNAKE CLONE

#ENDLESS TUNNEL RUNNER
# In Endless Tunnel Runner you control a green sphere with your mouse, be careful not to hit the falling cubes!
# Each cube you hit brings the walls in on you closer, limiting your space to maneuver in. Hit the walls and it's gameover!
# Press 'M' to mute the music and 'ESC' to exit

#SUPER HERO GAME
